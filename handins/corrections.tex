\title{\textbf{Calculation of Homology Groups\\for Simplicial Complexes\\ - Corrections}}

\maketitle

The following are corrections to the report "Calculation of Homology Groups for Simplicial Complexes" made after the deadline.
\begin{description}
\item[Definition 1.2 (faces)] Let $\Gamma$ be a structure of n vertices. An $l$-face of $\Gamma$ is a subset of the vertices of $\Gamma$ of cardinality $l+1$. The empty set, $\emptyset$, is the unique face of dimension $-1$.
\item[Definition 1.1] Let $n\in\{-1,0,1,\dots\}$. An n-simplex is a structure of $n+1$ vertices having all its faces. In particular $\emptyset$ is the $-1$-simplex.
\item[Comment] Note that the faces of an $n$-simplex are simplices themself and for a simplex an $l$-face is called an $l$-dimensional face.
\item[Definition 1.4] point 2 about properly situated can be omitted, since it only makes sense for geometric simplices.
