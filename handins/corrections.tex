\maketitle

The following are corrections to the report "Calculation of Homology Groups for Simplicial Complexes" made after the deadline.
\begin{description}
\item[Definition 1.2 (faces)] Let $\Gamma$ be a structure of n vertices. An $l$-face of $\Gamma$ is a subset of the vertices of $\Gamma$ of cardinality $l+1$. The empty set, $\emptyset$, is the unique face of dimension $-1$.
\item[Definition 1.1] Let $n\in\{-1,0,1,\dots\}$. An n-simplex is a structure of $n+1$ vertices having all its faces. In particular $\emptyset$ is the $-1$-simplex.
\item[Comment] Note that the faces of an $n$-simplex are simplices themself and for a simplex an $l$-face is called an $l$-dimensional face.
\item[Definition 1.4] point 2 about properly situated can be omitted, since it only makes sense for geometric simplices.
\item[Definition 1.6] The sum $x = \sum_{l=1}^kg_le_{\sigma_l}$ needs to be changed to $x = \sum_{l=1}^{m_i}g_le_{\sigma_l}$, where $m_i=|F_i(\Delta)|$ to avoid confusion about the meaning of $k$, similarly $\partial_i(x)=\sum_{l=1}^kg_l\partial (e_{\sigma_l})$ must be changed to $\partial_i(x)=\sum_{l=1}^{m_i}g_l\partial_i (e_{\sigma_l})$.

Note also that the index found using $\textnormal{index}(j)$ starts at 1.
